<MakeRailway_Hand.description>Make a Nail Gun - A home-made post-war development. The weapon works by forcing steam into a tank and then releasing it under high pressure, which sets a railroad nail in motion. As a result, the weapon makes a sound similar to a steam locomotive when reloading. This is an extremely effective weapon, capable of ripping off an enemy's limb, or even nailing him to a wall. It has excellent damage, but has a number of disadvantages - heavy weight, low rate of fire.</MakeRailway_Hand.description>

<PipeRifle.description>Create a Bolt Action Shotgun - A line of smoothbore guns - the simplest ballistic weapons, assembled, as they say, "on the knee", from various parts of found bolts, metal and wood. The sight of it makes you think it's more likely to kill the shooter than the target, but it's common in the Wasteland, and raiders prefer it that way.</PipeRifle.description>
