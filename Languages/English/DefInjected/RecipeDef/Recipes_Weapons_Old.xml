  <MakeRailway_Hand.description>Make a Nail Gun - A home-made post-war development. The weapon works by forcing steam into a tank and then releasing it under high pressure, which sets a railroad nail in motion. As a result, the weapon makes a sound similar to a steam locomotive when reloading. This is an extremely effective weapon, capable of ripping off an enemy's limb, or even nailing him to a wall. It has excellent damage, but has a number of disadvantages - heavy weight, low rate of fire.</MakeRailway_Hand.description>

  <PipeRifle.description>Create a Bolt-Pipe Rifle - The smoothbore line is the simplest ballistic weapon, assembled, as they say, "on the knee", from various parts of found bolts, metal and wood. Its appearance alone makes you think that it is more likely to kill the shooter than the target, but in the Wasteland it is common, and raiders prefer it.</PipeRifle.description>
