<MakeAmmo_Nail_HV.description>While the Railroad Spikes deal fairly moderate damage overall, they are extremely effective at damaging the limbs (arms, legs, and head) of an enemy, often being able to disable the corresponding body part after just one hit. And in case of a critical hit, it can be completely torn off and nailed to any nearby surface. Can be modified by adding explosives.</MakeAmmo_Nail_HV.description>
