<Bloodbug.label>Bloodbug</Bloodbug.label>
<Bloodbug.description>A giant mutant mosquito that inhabits the wastelands of the post-war Commonwealth. They are found both singly and in groups of up to 5. When non-aggressive, the bloodbug sits almost motionless on the ground or a brahmin corpse. It can sometimes sit in water, making it virtually invisible until it takes off to attack.</Bloodbug.description>

<Cazador.label>Cazador</Cazador.label>
<Cazador.description>A large mutated insect descended from the Pepsis grossa species, a member of the Pepsis road wasp family. They are most commonly found in the hilly and mountainous areas of the Mojave Desert, as well as in Zion Canyon and Big Mountain. Cazadors move very quickly in flight using their wings. If one or both wings are damaged, they begin to move on their legs, which significantly reduces their speed. Like all insects, when their antennae are damaged, they go berserk and attack any living creature.</Cazador.description>
