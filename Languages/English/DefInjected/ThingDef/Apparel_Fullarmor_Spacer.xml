<Apparel_RaiderPowerArmor.description>A power armor suit refurbished by raiders. Similar in ballistic protection and durability to the T-45 model, but has only two levels of improvements instead of six in factory models. Judging by its appearance, it is home-made. The set is somewhat similar in design to regular raider armor. The worst in its class, but even such armor makes its wearer a formidable opponent. Its main disadvantage is low durability.</Apparel_RaiderPowerArmor.description>
