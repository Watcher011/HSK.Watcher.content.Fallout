<NHE.label>Nuclear Strike</NHE.label>
<NHE.labelShort>"Big Baby"</NHE.labelShort>

<THE.label>Nuclear Strike, Ordered Time</THE.label>
<THE.labelShort>"Big Alarm Clock"</THE.labelShort>
<THE.description>The timer is 5 seconds. It does not explode on collision with other objects, so it bounces off walls or corners. Projectiles that directly hit enemies will deal damage in addition to causing a subsequent explosion.</THE.description>
